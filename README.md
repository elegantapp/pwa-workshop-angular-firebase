# Step 2

## Change web app manifest

>The [web app manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when â€˜installedâ€™ on the userâ€™s mobile device or desktop. Having a manifest is required by Chrome to show the [Add to Home Screen prompt](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/).

> A typical manifest file includes information about the app name, icons it should use, the start_url it should start at when launched, and more.

By adding PWA schematic of Angular, we've had an automatically generated manifest.json file at `src/manifest.json`. We need to change automatically generated fields in this file, as well as icons and more.

## Add application meta data to Web App Manifest file

`short_name` is the name of your PWA, when it's added to users' home screen.

`name` is used on automatically triggered A2HS popups on Android systems.

Please read WAMF specs on [Web App Manifest on Google Developers Portal](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/) and update your manifest.json as you wish.

## Add description field to Web App Manifest file

One of the improvement points that I see on the manifest.json file, which was generated by @angular/pwa schematic, is the addition of description field. Description field is documented on both [W3C Web App Manifest spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).

```
{
  "description": "This is a dummy Angular app which demonstrates a PWA's behaviour on different platforms."
}
```

>Providing a name, description and an app icon that is at least 512 x 512 pixels will help your app to be [automatically indexed and packaged on Microsoft Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/microsoft-store#automatic-pwa-importing-with-bing).

## Track the start url

It is a good practice to add a query string to the end of the `start_url` field in `manifest.json` file to track how often your installed app is launched from users' home screen.

```
{
  "start_url": "/?utm_source=home_screen"
}
```

## Change the theme color

Change the `theme_color` field in `manifest.json` file to `#387ef5`.

Update the value of the meta named `theme-color` in your `index.html` to `#387ef5`.

## Good to go ðŸŽ¯
Now you can continue to Step 3 -> [Add meta tags for icons and splash screens](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-workshop-angular-firebase/blob/step-3/README.md).
