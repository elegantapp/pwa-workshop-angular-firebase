# Congratulations! 🎉

Thanks for completing the workshop! You've done an amazing job!!

## What's next?

Since we've deployed our PWA for the first time, it's very important to see the behaviour of our app on multiple platforms.

* Install your PWA on different devices and platforms, including mobile and desktop.
* Release an update to your PWA and test the update flow on your device.
* Inspect the bundle size of your app on the OS of your mobile device.

## Add push notifications

As you might remember from Step 7, we had a bonus step to introduce push notifications. Take your time to discover Firebase Cloud Messaging and follow the instructions that are linked on https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-workshop-angular-firebase/blob/step-7/README.md#bonus-push-notifications to introduce push notifications to your app. 

## Participate in Web Capabilities codelab

Google leads a project called Fugu in order to close the capability gap of PWAs compared to native applications. [Read more about it here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities).

Participate in the [Web Capabilities codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-capabilities/) and introduce what you've learned from there to this app.

## Explore further Web APIs

Check out https://tomayac.github.io/pwa-feature-detector/ and https://whatwebcando.today/ to see some great set of Web APIs and introduce the ones that are interesting to you to this app.
