# Build a production ready PWA with Angular and Firebase

Welcome to the workshop of building a production ready Progressive Web App based on Angular, Ionic and Firebase.

The workshop is consist of 10 steps of producing a PWA by transforming a regular web app - [Ionic Conference App](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app/blob/master/) into a PWA and deploying it to Firebase.

The end application is purely a kitchen-sink demo of a PWA based on the Ionic Framework and Angular.

## How this workshop works?

Since we depend on Angular CLI and some other tools which are not available for online code editor environments, we're going to develop and build the app on our local computers.
